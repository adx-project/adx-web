          The <strong>ADX Data Standards (ADX-DS)</strong> is a standardized set of databases,
          variables, and formats that allow for easy exchange of data around AOs (Anomalous Observations).
        </p>
        <p>
          This database structure is constantly reviewed by experts in different fields, scientific or not,
          to ensure it contains all relevant data to describe observations. The ADX-DS also contains universal
          position and time variables to allow 3D reconstructions of events.
